# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Threads-NLP-
This project aims to classify the sentiment of text data into positive or negative categories using supervised machine learning techniques.

From the results of the sentiment analysis project, it's evident that Logistic Regression (LR) achieved the highest accuracy among the models tested, with an accuracy score of 87.1%. This suggests that for the specific dataset and problem domain, LR was the most effective in accurately classifying sentiment as positive or negative compared to other models like Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.

This repository contains code and resources for sentiment analysis using various machine learning algorithms. Below are the accuracy scores achieved by different models on the sentiment analysis task:

Logistic Regression (LR): 87.1%

Random Forest (RFM): 85.65%

Support Vector Machine (SVM): 86%

Kernel SVM (KSVM): 85.2%

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 84.35%

Decision Tree (DT): 84.5%

Naive Bayes (NB): 40.65%
